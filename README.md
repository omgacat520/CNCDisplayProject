readme for OkumaProject

(Jake, 8/26/20)
I already set up the logic for checking the variable and connecting to the API on the device, so that should be set already. We should be using API version 1.19. Austin said it is the most stable and code-ready API version.

Austin told me that the machines themselves have a startup program that monitors and makes sure the required programs are active, otherwise it'll initiate a restart/shutdown. Our program will be on there, so making sure this program initiates on startup shouldn't be an issue.

Current problems needing solving:
--Making the console minimize when the variable hasn't changed
--Making the console maximize when the variable has changed, and having the user input to make it minimize again.

The OkumaOpenAPI folder also has a help folder with the necessary documentation in .chm files. MC or Machine Center's are mills. It's just what people in the industry call mills, and I'm pretty sure we'll be testing on a mill, so using the MC documentation is probably best.
